# Relay React Concurrency Example

[Relay](https://relay.dev/) is designed for high performance at any scale. Relay keeps management of data-fetching easy, whether your app has tens, hundreds, or thousands of components. And thanks to Relayâ€™s incremental compiler, it keeps your iteration speed fast even as your app grows.. Relay Modern accomplishes this with static queries and ahead-of-time code generation.

This example only demonstrates the GrahQL consumption.
The data is provided by an existing [countries graphql api](https://github.com/trevorblades/countries).

## How to use

Run Relay ahead-of-time compilation (should be re-run after any edits to components that query data with Relay)

```bash
npm run relay
# or
yarn relay
```

Run the project

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
